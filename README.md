# Supervised learning using a quantum classifier

This machine learning module utilizes qubits to help speed up training. It is based off of the paper ["Supervised learning with a quantum classifier using a multi-level system"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08385.pdf). This is done through the utilization of Hilbert space. Hilbert space is perfect for machine learning. It is a vector space that is ideal for vector calculus, and machine learning is fancy vector calculus.

## Installation

Download Anaconda and install [environment_droplet.yml](Quantum_Machine_Learning/enviroment_droplet.yml) using the command
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
 to install the environment.
 NOTE: you may want to change "environment" to your desired environment name.


## Usage
In an anaconda enabled terminal navigate to the repo and type:
```bash
conda activate environment
jupyter notebook
```
This will launch the jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are interactive development environments. If you need to install anaconda [this page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) might help.
